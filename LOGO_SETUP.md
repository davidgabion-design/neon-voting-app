# Logo Setup Instructions

## ✅ Your Neon logo has been integrated!

### Required Action:

**Save your logo image as `neon-logo.png` in the root directory of the app.**

### Path:

```
voting-app/
  ├── neon-logo.png  ← Save your logo here
  ├── index.html
  ├── manifest.json
  └── ...
```

### What's Been Updated:

1. **Main App Branding**
   - Logo displays in top left corner
   - Title changed to "Neon Voting Platform"
   - Subtitle: "Secure Digital Elections"
   - Removed logo upload functionality (using fixed branding)

2. **Favicon & Tab Icon**
   - Browser tab shows your logo
   - Bookmarks use your logo

3. **PWA Manifest**
   - App name: "Neon Voting Platform"
   - Theme color: Purple (#9d00ff) matching your logo
   - Install icon: Your Neon logo

4. **Theme Colors**
   - Updated to match your logo's purple gradient

### Image Specifications:

**For best results:**

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Recommended size**: 512x512px or larger
- **File name**: `neon-logo.png` (exactly)
- **Location**: Root folder (same level as index.html)

### Optional: Create Additional Sizes

For better PWA support, you can also create:

- `icon-192.png` (192x192px version)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512px version)
- `favicon.ico` (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 multi-size)

But the main `neon-logo.png` will work for everything!
